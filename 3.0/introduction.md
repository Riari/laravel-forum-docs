Laravel Forum is a lean Laravel 4/5 package that provides an easy to integrate forum solution. Originally based on the [Laravel forum package written by Atrakeur](https://github.com/Atrakeur/laravel-forum), it has grown into a package aimed squarely at developers, with lots of integration options and a solid foundation for building bespoke discussion forums.

It makes as few assumptions as possible about your application and as a general rule, it only contains forum-specific features, leaving some of the more abstract ones (such as file attachments and statistics) to whichever implementations you decide to use. If you're looking for a more feature-complete forum solution, I highly recommend taking a look at [Flarum](http://flarum.org/), which is being built on Laravel.

See [Features](features.md) for a comprehensive list of existing, planned and precluded features.
