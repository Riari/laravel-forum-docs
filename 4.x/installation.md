## 4.x â€” Installation

Version 4 is compatible with Laravel 5.3 and above. Features, functionality and usage are identical to version 3, so please refer to the 3.x documentation after installation.

### Requirements

+ PHP 5.4 or above
+ Laravel 5.3

### Step 1: Install the package

Install the package via composer:

```
composer require riari/laravel-forum:~4.0
```

Then add the service provider to your `config/app.php`:

```php
Riari\Forum\ForumServiceProvider::class,
```

Installing the [front-end](3.x/front-end/introduction.md) is recommended. Note that version 3 of the front-end is compatible with versions 3 and 4 of the core package.

### Step 2: Publish the package files

Run the vendor:publish command to publish the package config, translations and migrations to your app's directories:

`php artisan vendor:publish`

### Step 3: Update your database

Run your migrations:

`php artisan migrate`

Assuming this succeeds, you can now define your forum categories in the `forum_categories` table.
